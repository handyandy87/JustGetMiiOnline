// Three settings, on top of Protarium's Inkay, which stays installed and in charge
// of everything else: which account server signs the console's tokens, which
// Miiverse it talks to, and which network serves SpotPass.
//
// The Miiverse swap happens in the gap the loader leaves between their module's write
// and the title's own entry point, keyed on what their module leaves behind, so their
// release cadence costs this plugin nothing. olv.h sets that out.
//
// The account server is the biggest of the three, because three things follow
// from it rather than one. It writes the account address, it turns off the game
// redirects their build performs by name, and it moves SpotPass to the same
// network wherever the pairing offers only one SpotPass. Those three were separate
// questions until it became clear they have one answer: a game server, a tasksheet
// and a sign-in token all belong to whichever account server issued the token, so
// a console with one of them on the other network isn't in a configuration
// anybody intended. That's why the redirects aren't a setting of their own, and why
// SpotPass became one only where Roseverse gives it a second answer, set out below.
//
// The account server comes first and the Miiverse starts from it, because each account
// server signs into one Miiverse by itself and hardware settled which: Juxt with
// Protarium accounts fails with 115-5016, and the same console with only the account
// server moved to Pretendo works. The pairing is a default, not a lock. Juxt stays
// selectable on Protarium and Protaverse on Pretendo, and on each of those the token
// request alone goes to the Miiverse's own account server. choice.h has the rule, by
// miiverse_routed. A later switch of account server leaves the Miiverse where it is,
// which account_changed in config.cpp sets out.
//
// Roseverse is the third Miiverse and the one that doesn't follow, because it's the
// one that isn't paired. It never asks an account server for a sign-in token: the
// token is built on the console instead, from the principal ID and a per-account key
// on the SD card. So there is no issuer to be wrong and no measured column, and the
// setting is legal under both. What the account server still decides is which
// principal ID that is, and Protarium's account server is a proxy in front of
// Pretendo's rather than one of its own, so the answer is the same number either way.
//
// SpotPass used to follow those two rather than being asked about, and it's the
// third setting now. What changed is that Roseverse has a SpotPass of its own, so the
// two Roseverse pairings have two answers and each one gives the other up:
// Protarium's carries Splatfests, Conquest and 100 Mario, and Rose's carries the
// WaraWara Plaza of the Miiverse actually in use. A console gets one of them. On
// Protarium the second answer stays off the menu unless Advanced Overrides, on the
// Debug page, is on, because a console on Protarium should keep Protarium's.
//
// It's still not a free choice. choice.h holds which values a pairing allows, the
// menu offers nothing else, and a stored value that isn't allowed falls back to that
// pairing's default. Protarium's stays the default wherever Protarium is the account
// server, because choosing a Miiverse isn't choosing to give up Splatfests.
//
// The defaults cost nothing, because on them this plugin writes nothing. Every body
// here starts by checking the setting, so an absent, unreadable or unrecognized
// stored value all end up in the same place: doing nothing.
//
// Memory search and replace is how two patchers end up destroying each other, so
// the rule in this project is: don't. This is the one place that breaks the rule,
// and the only place allowed to. There's no way to move Miiverse without it: the
// address isn't fixed and nobody exports it. So this is an exception, and it's
// narrowed by two promises rather than by luck. It never searches for Nintendo's
// string, which is the key their module consumes, only for what their module leaves
// behind, which nothing else wants. And every write is exactly as long as what it
// matched. Both are checkable by reading olv.cpp, and both have to survive any later
// change to it.
//
// The first of those promises was broken once, deliberately, and put back. Taking
// Nintendo's string got ahead of the library reading the URL, and it cost their
// module a full failed scan of memory at every title start, which hardware
// measured as five second transitions becoming forty. What gets ahead without
// taking anything is the gap the loader leaves before the title's entry point, and
// that's where the swap happens now, with no module needed. olv.h has the detail.

// The sign-in token used to be the one part of Roseverse this plugin didn't
// supply. It supplies it now, and what made that possible was finding a way to do
// it without carrying the thing that makes it work.
//
// Building the token needs an obfuscation constant that this repo doesn't carry.
// Embedding it would publish what they chose not to, and this plugin's license
// would then oblige it to publish it again as source. So it isn't embedded. The
// user keeps a copy of their module on the SD card, and an action in the menu reads
// the constant out of it once, on the console, and stores it. secret.h has the
// mechanism and token.h has the payload.
//
// With no imported constant the hook declines every request and the console
// behaves exactly as it does without this plugin, which is the same rule every
// other setting here follows.
//
// Whether Juxt accepts the sign-in token was the question the account server
// setting was added to answer, and hardware answered it: Protarium's account
// server answers that request itself rather than passing it upstream, and Juxt
// checks tokens against Pretendo's own records, so the swap lands and Miiverse
// still refuses with 115-5016. That's why the account server is a setting, and
// why the menu counts what was swapped: without the counts, a refusal and a swap
// that never landed would look the same.
//
// Juxt on Protarium gets around that by moving only the one request. When Miiverse
// asks for its token with Juxt selected on Protarium, token.cpp points the account
// server at Pretendo for the length of that call and account.cpp puts Protarium's
// address back afterwards, so the token comes from the server Juxt checks against.
// Protaverse on Pretendo lends the account server the other way, to Protarium, whose
// account server signs the tokens Protaverse is handed. It isn't a mirror of Juxt on
// Protarium, because a console on Pretendo never signed in through Protarium, and
// route() in token.cpp says why their account server should answer it anyway.
